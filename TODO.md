Stuff that needs to be done:

- Finish inplace subtraction. Further optimize the arithmetics class. Figure out a way to make universal macro for broadcast, reversed operators, inplace operators and elementwise operators without loosing performance.
- Add JIT (for backend)
- Finish code generation (despair :( ) consider using pybind11 for automatic bind generation
